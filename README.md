A script to automate bond data entry on treasurydirect. JavaScript via console.

Import your savings bonds quick(er) on treasurydirect https://www.treasurydirect.gov/BC/SBCPrice

Over time, the treasurydirect site has lost some basic functionality, leaving those with modern browsers no choice but to manually enter bonds into the calculator.

This script automates most of the data entry via the console. For a benchmark, I can enter 33 bonds in about 2 minutes with this script.

All that is required is an array of bond data.
